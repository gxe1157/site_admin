  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>My name is Jacqueline Molina, I am a veteran officer of the Newark Police Department and My Name is George Scott Pearson, recently retired and served 29 years with the Somerset County Sheriff’s department. We had the distinct honor of knowing the founding fathers of the NJLE Police Brotherhood Association and commend them for starting a Law Enforcement Organization that <span style='color:red'>helps officers and their families during their time of need or crisis.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, that organization had taken a different direction then Mr. Michael Sica Sr. had intended and has been dissolved. Therefore, Mrs., Joanna Sica, his widow, her daughter Kathy DeFranza Somerset County Sheriff's Officer George Scott Pearson and I, along with several other law enforcement officers throughout the state, decided to start the <span style='color:red'>Police Officers Brotherhood.</span> We want to preserve Mr. Sica’s views, values, programs and goals for which the brotherhood was originally intended by keeping the brother/sisterhood alive within the Law Enforcement Community.</p>
	<h3>Organizational Ideas</h3>
	<p>Mr. Sica, a 28 year veteran of the <b>Newark Police Department</b> established the idea of forming a <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>brotherhood organization</span> within law enforcement to take care of officers in need. Mr. Sica's family endured many trials and tribulations first hand with the political assassination of his son <b>Michael Sica, Jr</b> former Union County PBA President & State Delegate for standing up and fighting the many injustices that unfortunately plague our law enforcement profession. It was Michael’s passion and outspokenness to protect his members as their president that made him a political target. It was then that Mr. Sica Sr. realized there wasn’t any independent non-profit organization within the state, with the sole purpose of financially helping law enforcement officers and their families. Shortly thereafter, he decided to form an association that would protect and support law enforcement officers and their families during their time of need or crisis. President Sica never wanted to witness another law enforcement officers' family struggle with the financial strife, burden and emotional pain that his family suffered through during his son’s entire ordeal. </p>

	<h3>Our New Beginnings</h3>
	<p>For that same reason, we have formed the <b>“Police Officers Brotherhood”</b> and proudly accept the passing of the torch, which Mr. Sica carried and we will continue to keep the flame burning for those officers and their families who will need our help in the future.</p>
	<p>Our organization picks up where the Police Brotherhood left off. We stand up for the rights of all law enforcement officers and victims of crimes through planned fundraising events throughout the year. The NJLEPOB and its supporters have helped enrich the lives of many individuals throughout the state by donating thousands of dollars in the course of our fundraising events. This is accomplished through our law enforcement AD journal, honorary/associate membership programs and by having fundraisers that are supported by law enforcement officers, civilians and members of the business community. With your help, we will bring back the true meaning of brotherhood/sisterhood to the law enforcement community. Mr. Sica Sr. passed away several years ago and our organization proudly displays his name and president's message in his memory in order to keep his dream alive. We are working with the same vision, principles, ideas and goals that he started. The fruits of the brotherhoods labor can be seen by their actions as depicted throughout this website. </p>
	<p>We welcome you to browse our website to learn more about us. We urge officers, Family members, civilians and friends to come together and join us by becoming a member to form an alliance to help protect the pension system, health benefits and officers constitutional rights against the politicians who use them as a punch line for their own personal gain and political agenda. Thank you for your support and any help that you may be able to provide. Make a donation or become a member now to help us, help those officers who place their lives on the line everyday while serving and protect you the public! </p>
