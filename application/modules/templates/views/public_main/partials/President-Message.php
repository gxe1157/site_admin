	<h4>Dear Friend and Supporter,</h4>
	<p>My name is Michael Sica, Sr., and I am the president of the New Jersey Law Enforcement Police Brotherhood. I retired from the City of Newark as a Police Officer with approximately 28 years of Law Enforcement experience. During my law enforcement career I&#8217;ve worked in many different law enforcement units and assignments such as:</p>
	<p><strong>Police Patrol, Mayor&#8217;s Body Guard [Dignatary Protection], Detective Vice-Gambling, Detective Homicide Squad, Detective Rapid Robbery Squad, Prisoner Detention Bureau and Court Liaison Officer for 9 (nine) Municipal Court Judges.</strong></p>
	<p>As you can see I worked many different facets of our law enforcement community. There are similar duties that my career has touched on, such as correction officer, sheriff officer, parole officer and law enforcement tactical units. <b>They all serve a very important and integral part in our fighting on crime. All of our Law Enforcement Officers who serve in the many different Law Enforcement titles have a very tough and dangerous job when serving the taxpayers of the state of New Jersey.</b> <span style="background-color:yellow;">Every man and woman in uniform places his or her life on the line every day in one way or another to serve and protect you, the public.</span> They need to know that their efforts are appreciated and we will support them and commend them for a job well done under the circumstances.</p>

	<p><strong>Joined Newark Police Department in 1963 and served for 28 years.</strong></p>
	<p>In today&#8217;s society there are too many political agendas, special interest groups who are constantly criticizing our Law Enforcement Profession. Many of our Law Enforcement officers are frustrated because they are trying to do the best job </p>

	<p>that they possibly can to serve and protect the public, but too many times their decisions, actions and split-second reactions are constantly ridiculed and second guessed by the news media and public special interest groups. I am of the old adage, "Until you have walked a mile in my shoes, who are you to judge?"</p>
	<p>Most of the time these charges and accusations are made before a thorough investigation can be completed. This does a disservice to the officer and you the public. Once you take into consideration all of the Law Enforcement agencies with approximately 55,000 officers taking police action and arrests throughout New Jersey on a daily basis these few complaints should not tarnish the entire law enforcement community.</p>
	<p>The Brotherhood was formed with the front line law enforcement officers and victims of crimes in mind. <b>Our organization&#8217;s main goals and objectives are to assist law enforcement officers, their families and victims of crimes during their time of need or crisis.</b> We stands up for the rights of all law enforcement officers, NJ Citizens and the victims of crimes by supporting tough anti-crime legislation and policies that protect law enforcement officers and the victims of crimes. Take your time and browse through our website to learn more about our organization. We welcome any assistance that you may be able to provide. Thank you and God Bless.
